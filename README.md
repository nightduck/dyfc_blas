# dyfc BLAS

A BLAS implementation for Vitis HLS that strives to be as compliant as possible with the BLAS
specification, is as much as that's possible with a write/consume streaming platform.

Xilinx already has a BLAS library, but it's incomplete, poorly documented, and references
non-existent code. This aims to fix all of those issue.

This project is driven by one rule: Document **everything**

## Tests

See tests readme. Maybe summarize here

## Build

Build artifacts, currently also holds a component used for debugging new tests. Possibly move this to a new folder, debug.
